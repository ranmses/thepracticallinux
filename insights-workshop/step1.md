# Registering a machine to Red Hat Insights

In most Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 installations, the insights-client
software will be installed by default.  However, the minimal package
set does not include installing the insights-client package and other 
versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, while the package is available, 
will likely need it installed.  Install the insights-client package on 
the system.

`yum -y install insights-client`{{execute}}

Next, register your system with Red Hat Insights.

`insights-client --register`{{execute}}

<pre class=file>
You successfully registered 3c7e6bd4-2673-4d67-83f6-97cd2e420503 to account 6227255.

Starting to collect Insights data for a06560c57e40
Uploading Insights data.
Successfully uploaded report from a06560c57e40 to account 6227255.
</pre>

From the above output, you can observe that the system has been successfully
registered with Red Hat Insights.  As part of the registration,
the machine also uploads a report to Red Hat Insights so that
it may be analyzed for any issues.

For future reference, make note of your system hostname.

`hostname`{{execute}}

<pre class=file>
a06560c57e40
</pre>

>_NOTE:_ Your hostname will be different than the one listed in the output above

At any time in the future, you can get information about Insights registration
by using the `--status` option to `insights-client`.

`insights-client --status`{{execute}}
