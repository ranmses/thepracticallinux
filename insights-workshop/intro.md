After completing this scenario, users will be able to register a system with
Red Hat Insights and remediate issues that the Advisor tool has identified on 
the system.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Register a system with Red Hat Insights
* View Insights Advisor results that are reported for the system on cloud.redhat.com
* Apply a recommeded remediation for the system
* Validate the remediation by updating system information

# Example Usecase:
Administrators want to know about problematic configurations prior to
experiencing problems on systems.  Insights Advisor will look at data
provided to the Advisor service and compare it against known problematic
configurations and not only warn administrators through the service, but
provide step-by-step remediation instructions and often times an Ansible
playbook which can remediate the issue.


Feel free to try out other Insights included services like Vulnerability,
Compliance, Patch, and more.  We may add additional labs targeted to those
Insights applications as well.
